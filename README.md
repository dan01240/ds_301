# Wine Quality Prediction

## Summary
This project aims to analyze and predict the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the UCI Wine Quality Dataset, we seek to build predictive models that classify wine quality based on chemical properties such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH levels. Our goal is to reproduce the methodology outlined in the research paper and enhance the model's performance through additional preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning. Expected outcomes include identifying the most effective model for wine quality classification and understanding the impact of different features on predictions.

## Motivation
Wine quality assessment is traditionally conducted through sensory evaluation by experts, which is both subjective and costly. This project explores the possibility of automating this process using machine learning, reducing the dependency on human expertise while ensuring consistency in evaluation. The selected research paper provides a structured approach to classifying wine quality, making it an excellent foundation for our study. Additionally, this problem aligns well with real-world applications in the food and beverage industry, making it both relevant and impactful.
